## ü§ñ AI TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Pre-Testing Analysis
1. **Read CONTRACT-OBJECTIVES.md** for context and priorities
2. **Analyze contract code** against specified objectives
3. **Identify integration points** that need mocking
4. **Plan test coverage** for all critical areas

### Testing Execution Priority
1. **CRITICAL**: Security priorities (must pass 100%)
2. **HIGH**: Primary objectives (must pass 95%+)
3. **HIGH**: Business logic compliance (must pass 100%)
4. **MEDIUM**: Integration points (must pass 90%+)
5. **LOW**: Performance and optimization (must pass 80%+)

### Test Design Principles
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every objective must have dedicated tests
- **Edge Case Focus**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Security First**: Security tests take precedence over functionality
- **Business Compliance**: Exact adherence to business logic specifications
- **Integration Validation**: Mock external dependencies appropriately
